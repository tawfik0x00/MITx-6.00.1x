**Part B is dependent on your functions from ps4a.py, so be sure to complete ps4a.py before working on ps4b.py**

Now that you have completed your word game code, you decide that you would like to enable your computer (SkyNet) to play the game (your hidden agenda is to prove once and for all that computers are inferior to human intellect!) In this part, you will be able to compare how you as a user succeed in the game compared to the computer's performance.

You should look at the following two functions: compChooseWord and compPlayHand, before moving on to Problem 7 on the next page.
compChooseWord

If you follow the pseudocode for compChooseWord, you'll see that the code creates a computer player that is legal, but not always the best. Try to walk through and understand our implementation.

A Note On Runtime: You may notice that things run a bit slowly when the computer plays. This is to be expected - the wordList has 83667 words, after all! 
Test Cases to Understand the Code: 

>>> compChooseWord({'a': 1, 'p': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1}, wordList, 6) 
appels 
>>> compChooseWord({'a': 2, 'c': 1, 'b': 1, 't': 1}, wordList, 5) 
acta 
>>> compChooseWord({'a': 2, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'm': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12) 
immanent 
>>> compChooseWord({'x': 2, 'z': 2, 'q': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12) 
None

compPlayHand

Now that we have the ability to let the computer choose a word, we need to set up a function to allow the computer to play a hand - in a manner very similar to Part A's playHand function. This function allows the computer to play a given hand and is very similar to the earlier version in which a user selected the word, although deciding when it is done playing a particular hand is different.

Test Cases to Understand the Code: 

compPlayHand({'a': 1, 'p': 2, 's': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1}, wordList, 6)

Current Hand: a p p s e l

"appels" earned 110 points. Total: 110 points

Total score: 110 points.

compPlayHand({'a': 2, 'c': 1, 'b': 1, 't': 1}, wordList, 5)

Current Hand: a a c b t "acta" 

earned 24 points. Total: 24 points 

Current Hand: b Total score: 24 points. 

compPlayHand({'a': 2, 'e': 2, 'i': 2, 'm': 2, 'n': 2, 't': 2}, wordList, 12)

Current Hand: a a e e i i m m n n t t

"immanent" earned 96 points. Total: 96 points

Current Hand: a e t i

"ait" earned 9 points. Total: 105 points

Current Hand: e

Total score: 105 points.

----------------------------------

 Problem 7 - You and your Computer
20.0/20.0 points (graded)

Now that your computer can choose a word, you need to give the computer the option to play. Write the code that re-implements the playGame function. You will modify the function to behave as described below in the function's comments. As before, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand. Be sure to try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program.
Sample Output and Hints

Here is how the game output should look...

Hints about the output

Be sure to inspect the above sample output carefully - very little is actually printed out in this function specifically. Most of the printed output actually comes from the code you wrote in playHand and compPlayHand - be sure that your code is modular and uses function calls to these helper functions!

You should also make calls to the dealHand helper function. You shouldn't make calls to any other helper function that we've written so far - in fact, this function can be written in about 15-20 lines of code.

Here is the above output, with the output from playHand and compPlayHand obscured:

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: r
You have not played a hand yet. Please play a new hand first!
            
Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: u

<call to playHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: r

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: c

<call to compPlayHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: x
Invalid command.

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: me

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: c

<call to compPlayHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: n

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: u

<call to playHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: r

Enter u to have yourself play, c to have the computer play: c

<call to compPlayHand> 

Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: e

Hopefully this hint makes the problem seem a bit more approachable.

A Note On Runtime

You may notice that things run slowly when the computer plays. This is to be expected. If you want (totally optional!), feel free to investigate ways of making the computer's turn go faster - one way is to preprocess the word list into a dictionary (string -> int) so looking up the score of a word becomes much faster in the compChooseWord function.

Be careful though - you only want to do this preprocessing one time - probably right after we generate the wordList for you (at the bottom of the file). If you choose to do this, you'll have to modify what inputs your functions take (they'll probably take a word dictionary instead of a word list, for example).

IMPORTANT:Don't worry about this issue when running your code in the checker below! We load a very small sample wordList (much smaller than 83667 words!) to avoid having your code time out. Your code will work even if you don't implement a form of pre-processing as described.

Entering Your Code

Be sure to only paste your definition for playGame from ps4b.py in the following box. Do not include any other function definitions.
