 Problem 2 - PlaintextMessage
15.0/15.0 points (graded)

For this problem, the graders will use our implementation of the Message class, so don't worry if you did not get the previous parts correct.

PlaintextMessage is a subclass of Message and has methods to encode a string using a specified shift value. Our class will always create an encoded version of the message, and will have methods for changing the encoding.

Implement the methods in the class PlaintextMessage according to the specifications in ps6.py. The methods you should fill in are:

    __init__(self, text, shift): Use the parent class constructor to make your code more concise.
    The getter method get_shift(self)
    The getter method get_encrypting_dict(self): This should return a COPY of self.encrypting_dict to prevent someone from mutating the original dictionary.
    The getter method get_message_text_encrypted(self)
    change_shift(self, shift): Think about what other methods you can use to make this easier. It shouldn’t take more than a couple lines of code.

Paste your implementation of the entire PlaintextMessage class in the box below.
